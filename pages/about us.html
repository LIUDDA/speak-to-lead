                    organization, you need to look at the impact you are making when you speak. <br>

                Each day presents us with the opportunity to engage with the people around us – whether it is
                establishing relationships with stakeholders, motivating team members, persuading teachers or promoting
                our work to the public.

                <u>What we say, and how we say it, matters.</u> With attention spans declining, the challenge to keep
                audiences
                focused and engaged has never been greater. But this represents an opportunity for those who can do so.

                                Your confidence levels will grow as you go from speaking to small groups of people up to
                                large audiences. This will benefit you not just on stage, but in everyday life as well,
                                whether it be in a meeting or on a date

                            <p>Public speaking is an excellent way to build critical thinking skills. Writing a speech
                                requires a great deal of careful thought, from the audience analysis to the closing
                                sentence. It's not enough to have a message, you also need to figure out how to tailor
                                the message to fit the needs of your audience.
                            </p>

                                Communication skills are crucial for personal and professional success and improving
                                this area is one of the greatest benefits of public speaking. Preparing a speech forces
                                speakers to take a step back and think critically about effective ways to communicate.
                                In everyday life, it’s easy to fall back on communication habits we formed many years
                                ago.

                            <p>
                                If you let others do your talking for you in the past or found it hard to express what
                                you wanted to say, that will fade. Not only will you be able to fluently speak your mind
                                but you'll find yourself doing it for others too.

                                In standing up and speaking in a way that is powerful, you're speaking in a way that
                                will change people’s minds about something. If you're able to master that skill,
                                changing hearts and minds and learning how to persuade, you will be already honing one
                                of the major aspects of leadership.

                                If you're able to do it in public to a group of people, chances are you'll be able to do
                                it in a more individualized setting. Leaders require the capacity to drive change,
                                public speaking skills are vital in learning that ability.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                You'll know the effect of the words you choose to express your message and you'll also
                                know they need to be different for different audiences. As well as having a flexible
                                vocabulary, you'll no longer use common filler words we hear in everyday conversation
                                indicating that the speaker may be unsure about what they're saying or anxious about
                                speaking.

                            <p>
                                Listening may be a lost art, but a public speaking course actually teaches you to become
                                a better listener. When you attend conferences, you’ll hear several different types of
                                speeches about a wide variety of topics, from people who may be very different from you.
                                This will passively build your listening ability and note taking.
