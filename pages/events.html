                            “Music gives a soul to the universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination, and life
                            to
                            everything.” – Plato
                            Music is a blessing. It’s something that everybody enjoys, and anyone can feel. It’s the way
                            the
                            soul of the artist expresses itself into this dimension if it can’t be done through words.

                            ”Books made into movies”
                            The book is a film that takes place in the mind of the reader. That's why we go to movies
                            and
                            say, "Oh, the book is better"
                            Have you read any books that have been made into films?
                            Which version did you prefer, the book or the film?

                            ”Media Literacy”
                            This week we are going to find out how to develop skills and habbits of media literacy.
                            These skills include being able to access media on a basic level, to analize it in a
                            critical way based on certain key concepts, to evaluate it hinged on that analisis, and,
                            finally, to produce media oneself. This process of learning media literacy skills is
                            media education.

                            ”Goal Setting”
                            The height of a person's existence lies not in his/her ability to merely survive, but in
                            discovering what to live for. Having a well-defined goal in life is crucial to understanding
                            the direction of our career and pursuing these goals

                        <i>It was about music!</i> 
                        Our amazing team SPEAK TO LEAD have enjoyed the most beautiful moments with our skilled and
                        precious presenters, who have lively shared fabulous experiences about music - <b>*MUSIC HEALS YOUR
                        SOUL * .</b> 
                        <i> <u>Each session comes to demonstrate an improvement in communication skills and self-confidence.</u> </i> In
                        this order, the interaction we have had today showed that a presenter can play the role of a
                        moderator, an animator, a guide, and a trainer!
                        Thank you for the informative presentations and self-knowledge exercises, the development of
                        language skills tasks and quizzes that captured the interest of the participants. As the poet
                        and author Berthold Auerbach once stated, “Music washes away from the soul the dust of everyday
                        life", for sure today's meeting had a miraculous calming and relaxing effect on the
                        participants. <u> Millions of thanks to all the presenters for this unique opportunity to find out a
                        lot of interesting, useful information related to music.</u>  It was a great pleasure to have the
                        chance to know so intelligent pupils who inspire other pupils to learn new insights with love!
                        All together you are a golden box full of ideas, intelligence, creativity, and emotions! <br>

                       <i><b>Women's History Month is celebrated every March - but why is it important? What does it mean?</b> </i>  <br>
                        We celebrate Women's History Month <u>to remind ourselves of the accomplishments of women
                        throughout the years to our culture and society</u> . From science to politics, it's is a chance to
                        reflect on the trailblazing women who lead the way for change.
                        Today, the <b><u> SPEAK TO LEAD CLUB</u></b>  with the support of <i>English Language teachers Guțu Ludmila and
                        Elena Magu</i>  has explored the vital role of women for human civilization throughout modern
                        history, including the impact of World War I on women's rights and the granting of voting rights
                        to women. We also highlighted the inappropriate stereotypes for both girls and boys, the
                        presence of gender inequality that exists today. Or, the way we celebrate women in our own lives
                        must always be unique.
                        Women, of course, are also a part of history for the other 11 months of the year. And I would
                        add that women were influencing the course of history long before 1980, or 1911. Nevertheless, I
                        am glad that there is, each year, a time when we pause to think about the role of women because
                        history is more than simply what happened, and more than what women and men did to make it
                        happen. History is what we remember about those deeds. It is the lessons we have taken from the
                        past and the knowledge we draw on to live today and to shape the future.

                        As you probably know, some of the greatest movies in the history of film were adapted from
                        books…<i>films that I can’t even imagine what the world of film would look like today if they
                        never came to be</i> . We hope you found the experience of reading a book before watching the movie
                        as fantastic as we think. Being able to imagine everything that is written and then, seeing if
                        what you imagined is what the director chose to put in the movie is incredible. Furthermore,
                        reading and watching a story, you get the full experience of it and you are able to be critical
                        about it, since you have seen both sides, and remember: <br> <i><b>NEVER JUDGE A BOOK BY IT'S MOVIE!!!</b></i>
